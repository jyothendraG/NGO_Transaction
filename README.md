# DApp BoilerPlate

## Overview

This DApp BoilerPlate provides a basic structure to kickstart your decentralized application (DApp) development. It includes a frontend React component (`DesignPage.jsx`) and a placeholder for your smart contract (`YourContract.sol`). You can customize and build upon this BoilerPlate to create your own DApp with Ethereum blockchain integration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start the DApp:

### 1. Smart Contract

- Place your smart contract file (`YourContract.sol`) in the `contracts` folder and also name the contract `YourContract`.
- Ensure your Solidity version is correctly specified in `truffle-config.js`.

### 2. Compile and Deploy

- Open Ganache and ensure it's running.
- Run the deploy command in the terminal:
  ```bash
  truffle migrate --network development
  ```

### 3. Frontend

- In the terminal, navigate to the `build` directory.
- Install dependencies by running:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### 4. Configure MetaMask

- Open MetaMask and import accounts from Ganache.

### 5. Run the DApp

- Start the React app by running:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### 6. Start Developing

- Open the `DesignPage.jsx` component in the `build` folder.
- Begin developing your DApp's smart contract function interactions.

## Additional Notes

- Customize the `DesignPage.jsx` component to add specific functionality and UI elements for your DApp.
- Explore and experiment with Ethereum smart contract interactions using the provided BoilerPlate.
